# ATVSpecs
SwiftUI tvOS app for viewing device information.

## Information
- This personal project is a way to view system information on an Apple TV.
- Makes use of ProcessInfo and other functions to get information on storage, processor, memory, and more.

## Examples
![An image of the storage view displaying free and used available space inside a ring circle that is filled clockwise based on used storage with a refresh button at the bottom.](Assets/Storage.png)
![An image of the miscellaneous view displaying different kinds of information for processor, memory, host, and a refresh button.](Assets/Misc.png)

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running tvOS (will display information from your Mac if simulated) or a physical Apple TV as a destination.

This is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI. Feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal use!
